{"title":"Advertiser Lookup","content":"## Advertiser Lookup API\n\nThe *Advertiser Lookup API* from **Commission Junction** allows to search advertisers on the platform and filter them by a variety of dimensions.\n\n> Please check the official documentation for the *Commission Junction Advertiser Lookup API* for details on filter parameters. This can be accessed in the [Commission Junction Support Center](https://cjcommunity.force.com/s/article/Advertiser-Lookup-API-4777195) after login.\n\nPlease note that **at least one** of the following parameters has to be provided in order for the API to return anything: advertiser-ids, keywords or advertiser-name.\n\n### Response normalization\n\nhibase does not perform any particular transformation onto data returned by this endpoint. Here is an example of what a product record might look like:\n\n```json\n  {\n    \"ad_id\": 12345678,\n    \"advertiser_id\": 12345678,\n    \"advertiser_name\": \"My Shop\",\n    \"advertiser_category\": \"Fashion\",\n    \"buy_url\": \"https://...\",\n    \"catalog_id\": \"cat:1234\",\n    \"currency\": \"EUR\",\n    \"description\": \"Lorem ipsum...\",\n    \"image_url\": \"https://...\",\n    \"in_stock\": \"true\",\n    \"isbn\": \"12345678\",\n    \"manufacturer_name\": \"My Brand\",\n    \"manufacturer_sku\": \"12345678\",\n    \"name\": \"My Product\",\n    \"price\": 42.0,\n    \"retail_price\": 42.0,\n    \"sale_price\": 42.0,\n    \"sku\": \"12345678\",\n    \"upc\": \"12345678\"\n  }\n```\n\n### Pagination\n\nThe *Advertiser Lookup API* is automatically paginated by **hibase** until the full records set has been returned."}
