Navigate to the [Zoho Developer Console](https://api-console.zoho.eu/) and create a _Self Client_ if one is not already available\n\n2. Note down the *Client ID* and *Client Secret* that are provided by the console\n\n3. Determine which *domain* of the Zoho API you are using and note it down. The available options are as follows:\n  - For US: https://accounts.zoho.eu\n  - For AU: https://accounts.zoho.eu.au\n  - For EU: https://accounts.zoho.eu\n  - For IN: https://accounts.zoho.in\n  - For CN: https://accounts.zoho.com.cn\n\n4. Navigate to the *Generate Code* tab and paste the following line in *Scope* for complete read access (you can adapt scopes according to what you would like hibase to have access to): \n\n```\nZohoBooks.fullaccess.read,ZohoCRM.modules.custom.read,ZohoCRM.modules.contacts.read,ZohoCRM.modules.read,ZohoCRM.settings.read,ZohoCRM.users.read,ZohoCRM.org.read,ZohoCRM.coql.read\n```\n\n5. Give a description to the Scope (e.g. \"hibase full access\") and hit *Generate*\n\n6. Copy the code that is generated\n\n7. Use an HTTP client to make a POST request to the Zoho API and fetch a refresh token, which you will need to provide as credentials to the *Zoho connector* in *hibase*. For example, you can use `curl` from your terminal as follows:\n\n```\ncurl -v -X POST \\\n  --data-urlencode \"code=[Code generated in step 5]\" \\\n  --data-urlencode \"client_id=[Client ID]\" \\\n  --data-urlencode \"redirect_uri=hibase.co\" \\\n  --data-urlencode \"client_secret=[Client Secret]\" \\\n  --data-urlencode \"grant_type=authorization_code\" \\\n  --data-urlencode \"access_type=offline\" \\\n  [Zoho API Domain as in step 3]/oauth/v2/token\n```\n\n8.

Navigate to the *Certificates & secrets* page of your App and click on *New client secret* to issue a new secret. Take note of it as it will be required later in the process\n\n4. Navigate to the *API permissions* page of your new App and add the following **Delegated permissions**, all of which are available under *Microsoft Graph*:\n\n  - Files.Read.All\n  - Sites.Read.All\n  - User.Read\n\n5. In your browser, navigate to the following URL after replacing *Client ID* and *Tenant ID* with the values you noted above:\n\n```\nhttps://login.microsoftonline.com/[Tenant ID]/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?client_id=[Client ID]&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flocalhost&scope=offline_access%20user.read%20files.read%20sites.read.all\n```\n\n6. You will be redirected to your `localhost`, most likely resulting in a \"This site can't be reached\" page in your browser. Copy the URL from the URL bar and take note of the value of the `code` param therein included. This is the *Authorization Code* you will need in the following step\n\n7. Issue a POST request as follows, replacing all the values in brackets with the ones you noted above (the example is using curl):\n\n```\ncurl -v -X POST \\\n  --data-urlencode \"grant_type=authorization_code\" \\\n  --data-urlencode \"client_id=[Client ID]\" \\\n  --data-urlencode \"code=[Authorization Code]\" \\\n  --data-urlencode \"scope=offline_access user.read files.read sites.read.all\" \\\n  --data-urlencode \"redirect_uri=https://localhost\" \\\n  --data-urlencode \"client_secret=[Client Secret]\" \\\n  https://login.microsoftonline.com/[Tenant ID]/oauth2/v2.0/token\n```\n\n8.

Please get in touch in case you are reaching your limits and you would like them to be increased. \n\nYou can still take back control of the API call and retrieve a specific set of records by manually providing a `pageToken` parameter in your `query`.
