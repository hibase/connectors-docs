If given no other instruction, it will do so until an empty data set is returned or the `nextPageToken` parameter is not returned anymore. \n\n> **NB**: Limits apply to how many subsequent calls can be made through automatic pagination. Please get in touch in case you are reaching your limits and you would like them to be increased. \n\nYou can still take back control of the API call and retrieve a specific set of records by manually providing a `pageToken` parameter in your `query`. In this case, hibase will not iterate any further regardless of what `nextPageToken` is returned by the API."},{"url":"/commission-junction/apis/endpoints/product-catalog-search/","title":"Product Catalog Search","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"hibase-connector-docs","url":"/"},{"title":"Commission Junction"},{"title":"Apis","url":"/commission-junction/apis/"},{"title":"Product Catalog Search","url":"/commission-junction/apis/endpoints/product-catalog-search/"}],"content":"## Product Catalog Search API\n\nThe *Product Catalog Search API* from **Commission Junction** allows to search the products catalog and filter it by a variety of dimensions.\n\n> Please check the official documentation for the *Commission Junction Product Catalog Search API* for details on filter parameters.
