{"title":"Reporting Api V4","content":"# Google Analytics Reporting API (v4)\n\n### Getting started\n\nIn order to start using the hibase connector to the Google Analytics API (v4), you first need to set up a [*Service Account*](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v2/authorization#service_accounts) within your Google Analytics account.\n\n1. Navigate to your [Google APIs Dashboard](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/dashboard) and check whether a *Project* already exsists for your app\n\n2. If a project was not already set up, you can do so through this [Setup tool](https://console.developers.google.com/start/api?id=analytics&credential=client_key)\n\n3. Navigate to the [Google APIs Library](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library) and activate the [**Google Analytics Reporting** API](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/analyticsreporting.googleapis.com) for the project if it was not already activated\n\n4. Navigate to the [Credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials) tab and select *Create credentials -> Service account key*\n\n5. Save your credentials as JSON. **Warning**: Store this file securely as this is the only time you will be able to download it\n\n6. You will now have to add the newly created user to your Google Analytics account. [Sign in](https://analytics.google.com/), click on *Admin* in the bottom-left corner and then on *User Management* under the account / property or view you want to give hibase access to\n\n7. In the *Account users* list, click on + in the top-right corner and then on *Add new users*\n\n8. As an email address, enter the `client_email` that you see in the JSON file saved at step 5. As permissions, select *Read & Analyze*\n\n9. Back to hibase, add a new **Google Analytics API (v4)** Connector and fill your *client email* and *private key*, which you can find in the downloaded JSON file\n\n  **Important:** make sure you correctly add **line breaks** to your private key, by substituting any occurrence of `\\n` in the JSON file with an actual line break. From:\n\n  ```json\n  \t-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\\nXXXXXXXXXXXXX...\n  ```\n\n  ... to:\n\n  ```json\n  \t-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n  \tXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n  \tXXXXXXXXXXXXX...\n  ```\n\n10. Save the connector and you are good to go\n\nIn case you experience issues querying the API, check again the steps above and especially that you copied your *private key* correctly (step 6). You can edit the Connector you just added at any time and overwrite the credentials you originally provided."}
