Log into your Microsoft Advertising account as *Super Admin* and navigate to the [Developers Portal](https://developers.ads.microsoft.com/Account)\n\n2. Select which user you want to use in order to log in from hibase and hit *Request Token* in order to get your *Developer Token*\n\n3. Register a new app in your [Azure account](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) with the following settings:\n\n  - **Name**: *hibase Bing Ads Reporting API*\n  - **Supported account types**: *Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)*\n  - **Redirect URI**: `https://localhost`\n\n4. Take note of the *Client ID* that is displayed at the top of your new App's page\n\n5. Navigate to the *Certificates & secrets* page of your App and click on *New client secret* to issue a new secret. Take note of it as it will be required later in the process\n\n6. In your browser, navigate to the following URL after replacing *Client ID* with the values you noted above:\n\n```\nhttps://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?client_id=[Client ID]&scope=openid%20profile%20https://ads.microsoft.com/ads.manage%20offline_access&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https://localhost&prompt=login\n```\n\n7. After granting access to the application, you will be redirected to your `localhost`, most likely resulting in a \"This site can't be reached\" page in your browser. Copy the URL from the URL bar and take note of the value of the `code` param therein included. This is the *Authorization Code* you will need in the following step\n\n8. Issue a POST request as follows, replacing all the values in brackets with the ones you noted above (the example is using curl):\n\n```\ncurl -v -X POST \\\n  --data-urlencode \"grant_type=authorization_code\" \\\n  --data-urlencode \"client_id=[Client ID]\" \\\n  --data-urlencode \"code=[Authorization Code]\" \\\n  --data-urlencode \"scope=offline_access https://ads.microsoft.com/ads.manage openid profile\" \\\n  --data-urlencode \"redirect_uri=https://localhost\" \\\n  --data-urlencode \"client_secret=[Client Secret]\" \\\n  https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/token\n```\n\n9. Take note of the *Refresh token* provided in the response\n\n10. Provide your *Client ID*, *Client Secret*, *Developer Token* and *Refresh Token* to the hibase connector for Microsoft Graph when adding it to your account. Additionally. write `https://localhost` as *Redirect Uri*\n\nYou are now ready to start using the *Microsoft Bing Ads Reporting API* connector for *hibase*"}
