{"title":"Rest Api","content":"# Zoho CRM Rest API (v2)\n\n### Getting started\n\nFollow the steps below in order to start using the hibase connector to the Zoho CRM API (v2):\n\n1. Navigate to the [Zoho Developer Console](https://api-console.zoho.eu/) and create a _Self Client_ if one is not already available\n\n2. Note down the *Client ID* and *Client Secret* that are provided by the console\n\n3. Determine which *domain* of the Zoho API you are using and note it down. The available options are as follows:\n  - For US: https://accounts.zoho.eu\n  - For AU: https://accounts.zoho.eu.au\n  - For EU: https://accounts.zoho.eu\n  - For IN: https://accounts.zoho.in\n  - For CN: https://accounts.zoho.com.cn\n\n4. Navigate to the *Generate Code* tab and paste the following line in *Scope* for complete read access (you can adapt scopes according to what you would like hibase to have access to): \n\n```\nZohoBooks.fullaccess.read,ZohoCRM.modules.custom.read,ZohoCRM.modules.contacts.read,ZohoCRM.modules.read,ZohoCRM.settings.read,ZohoCRM.users.read,ZohoCRM.org.read,ZohoCRM.coql.read\n```\n\n5. Give a description to the Scope (e.g. \"hibase full access\") and hit *Generate*\n\n6. Copy the code that is generated\n\n7. Use an HTTP client to make a POST request to the Zoho API and fetch a refresh token, which you will need to provide as credentials to the *Zoho connector* in *hibase*. For example, you can use `curl` from your terminal as follows:\n\n```\ncurl -v -X POST \\\n  --data-urlencode \"code=[Code generated in step 5]\" \\\n  --data-urlencode \"client_id=[Client ID]\" \\\n  --data-urlencode \"redirect_uri=hibase.co\" \\\n  --data-urlencode \"client_secret=[Client Secret]\" \\\n  --data-urlencode \"grant_type=authorization_code\" \\\n  --data-urlencode \"access_type=offline\" \\\n  [Zoho API Domain as in step 3]/oauth/v2/token\n```\n\n8. Copy the *Refresh token* that is provided by the HTTP response\n\n9. Provide the *API URL* (as in step 3), *Client ID*, *Client Secret* and *Refresh token* to the hibase Zoho CRM connector"}
