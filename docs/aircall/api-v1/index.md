# Aircall API (v1)

### Getting started

In order to start using the **hibase** connector to the [Aircall API (v1)](https://developer.aircall.io/api-references/), you need to fetch an *API ID* and *API Token* (as described in the [Basic Auth](https://developer.aircall.io/api-references/#basic-auth-aircall-customers) section of the Aircall docs).

1. Go to your [Company Settings](https://dashboard-v2.aircall.io/company) page in Aircall

2. In the *API Keys* section, click on *Add a new API key*

3. Copy the `api_token` and `api_id` that are provided

4. In **hibase**, provide the *API Token* and *API ID* you just copied when adding the *Aircall API* connector
