# Airtable API (v0)

### Getting started

In order to start using the **hibase** connector to the [Airtable API (v0)](https://airtable.com/api), you need to create an *API Key* for your account and retrieve the *Base ID* of the project you want to connect to.

1. Log into your [Airtable account](https://airtable.com/account), click on *Generate API key* and copy its value

2. Navigate to the [Airtable API docs](https://airtable.com/api) and select the project you want to connect to. The *Base ID* of the project will be shown at the top of the page

3. In **hibase**, provide the *API Key* and *Base ID* you just copied when adding the *Airtable API* connector
