# Amplitude API (v2)

### Getting started

In order to start using the **hibase** connector to the [Amplitude API (v2)](https://developers.amplitude.com/docs), you need to fetch an *API Key* and *Secret Key* for the project you want to connect to.

1. Log into your [Amplitude account](https://analytics.amplitude.com/login)

2. Click on *Settings* and navigate to your *Projects* page

3. Select the Project you want to connect to hibase. You will have to add new credentials in hibase for every Project you want to connect to

4. Copy the *API Key* and *Secret Key* for the Project

5. In **hibase**, provide the *API Key* and *Secret Key* you just copied when adding the *Amplitude API* connector
