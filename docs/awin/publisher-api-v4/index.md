In order to start using the **hibase** connector to the [Awin Publisher API (v4)](http://wiki.awin.com/index.php/Publisher_API), you need to create an *API Token* for your account.

1. Log into your [Awin Dashboard](https://ui.awin.com/awin-api) and navigate to the [API Credentials](https://ui.awin.com/awin-api) page

2. Type in your password and click on *Show my API token*, then copy the *OAuth2 Token* that is displayed

3. Navigate to your [Manage Accounts](https://ui.awin.com/user/settings/accounts) page and copy the ID of the Publisher account you want to query from hibase, shown in parentheses next to the account name

4. In **hibase**, provide the *API Token* and *Publisher ID* you just copied when adding the *Awin Publisher API* connector
