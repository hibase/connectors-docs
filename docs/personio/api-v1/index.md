# Personio API (v1)

### Getting started

In order to start using the **hibase** connector to the [Personio API (v1)](https://developer.personio.de/docs), you need to fetch *Client ID* and *Client secret* for your Personio account.

1. Go to your [Personio account](https://www.personio.com/login/)

2. In the *Settings > API Credentials* section, click on *Generate new credential*

3. Copy the `client_id` and `client_secret` that are provided

4. In **hibase**, provide the *Client ID* and *Client secret* you just copied when adding the *Personio API* connector
