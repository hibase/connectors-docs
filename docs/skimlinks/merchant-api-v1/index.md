# Skimlinks Merchant API (v3)

### Getting started

In order to start using the **hibase** connector to the [Skimlinks Merchant API (v3)](http://developers.skimlinks.com/merchant.html), you need to retrieve your *API Key* from the [Skimlinks Publisher Hub](https://hub.skimlinks.com):

1. Log into your [Skimlinks Publisher Hub](https://hub.skimlinks.com)

2. Navigate to [*Toolbox > APIs > API Authentication Credentials*](https://hub.skimlinks.com/toolbox/api#credentials) and copy your *Account Type*, *Account ID* and *Public Key*

3. In **hibase**, provide the information you just copied when adding the *Skimlinks Merchant API* connector

4. Save the connector and you are good to make requests to the *Skimlinks Merchant API*
