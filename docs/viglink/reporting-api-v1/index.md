# VigLink Reporting API (v1)

### Getting started

In order to start using the **hibase** connector to the [*VigLink Reporting API (v1)*](https://viglink-developer-center.readme.io/docs), you need to retrieve your *API Key* and *Secret Key* from the [VigLink Dashboard](https://sessions.viglink.com/sign-in).

For Publishers:

1. Log into your [VigLink Dashboard](https://sessions.viglink.com/sign-in) and navigate to [*Settings > Sites*](https://publishers.viglink.com/publisher/sites)

2. Click on the **key icon** next to the name of the Site you want to integrate with **hibase** (note that **depending on the API endpoint used**, multiple sites might require multiple credentials to be added in **hibase**)

3. Copy the *API Key* and *Secret Key* that are displayed on the screen, or generate them if needed

4. In **hibase**, provide both the keys you just copied when adding the *VigLink Reporting API* connector
